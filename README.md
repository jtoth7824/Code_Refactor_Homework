# Code Refactoring

#### By John Toth

## Description

This project demonstrates taking a webpage that only utilized <div> tags and convert them to semantic tags in order to have accessibility.   The other aspect of this project was to add anything to the html that would provide better search engine optizmiation.  Lastly, the style sheet was cleaned up to follow the flow of the semantic tags and also consolidate/combine any duplicate styling to make the CSS simpler.
